# VisageAI

## Inspiration:

With the advancement of AI, the number of AI-generated images online has increased, making it more challenging to distinguish them from real images. This project addresses this issue by implementing a classification model designed to differentiate between AI-generated and real images.

## What it does:

This project allows the user to differentiate real images from AI generated ones on a interactive website. 

## How we built it:

This application combines a Flask backend with TensorFlow for AI processing with interactive front end. 


Backend: Python Flask 
AI Model: TensorFlow (Keras) 
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 
Design: Custom CSS with responsive design patterns

## Challenges we ran into:

JIWON ADD CHALLENGES

## Accomplishments that we're proud of:

We successfully demonstrated and developed the proof of concept that we envisioned at the start of the project.

## What we learned:

Besides learning new technologies and new skills, we were able to learn how to launch our porject onto the cloud for others to use aswell.
